Introduction
============

udisks-glue is a tool that can associate udisks events to user-defined
actions. In that sense, udisks-glue is almost "glue code"[1], hence the name.

udisks (formely known as DeviceKit-disks) is an abstraction layer on top of
the Linux disks subsystems that, in conjunction with the other DeviceKit
subprojects, aims to be a replacement for the now almost defunct HAL project.

Like most other recent Linux desktop frameworks, udisks exposes its API via
DBus to its clients (often desktop environments). Users wishing to have more
control about what happens when specific disk-related events often have to use
a tool like halevt[2] or ivmon[3], which work on top of HAL. Now that HAL is
no longer being actively developed and most distributions are considering
dropping support for it, those users will have to migrate to a new tool, and
udisks-glue might as well fill that gap.

udisks-glue should eventually offer the most useful features found in the
aforementioned projects. As of now, however, only the most basic functionality
is available (mounting and unmounting removable media). Contributions are
welcome.

Note that this project is not affiliated with or endorsed by the udisks
project.

Configuration
=============

udisks-glue is configured by a simple configuration file in the canonical
configuration format found (the libConfuse format). This configuration file
can be specified on the command line (the -c or --config switch). If no
configuration file is supplied on the command line, udisks-glue will try the
following locations in that order:

1. ~/.config/udisks-glue/udisks-glue.conf
2. ~/.udisks-glue.conf
3. $SYSCONFDIR/udisks-glue.conf

Here's a sample configuration file that should be self-explanatory:

#
# Filters
#

filter disks {
    optical = false
}

filter burnable {
    optical = true
    disc_closed = false
}

filter optical {
    optical = true
}

#
# The default entry
#

default {
    post_mount_command = "mount-notify %device_file %mount_point"
    post_removal_command = "mount-notify %device_file removed"
}

#
# Additional entries
#

match disks {
    post_insertion_command = "udisks --mount %device_file --mount-options sync"
}

match burnable {
    post_insertion_command = "k3b %device_file"
    post_mount_command = ""
}

match optical {
    post_insertion_command = "udisks --mount %device_file --mount-options ro"
}

The udisks command should be shipped with your distribution, make sure to read
its manual page for details. mount-notify could be a script that uses whatever
means to notify you about what's going on. You might want to display a popup
of some sort or update some widget on your desktop.

Note that the filters are parsed in the order they are specified, so you want
to have the most specific filters specified first (otherwise the less specific
filters will match).

You probably want to run this software as your current user as opposed to
running it as root, so that you can have access to the directories mounted
with the udisks command, since udisks can use PolicyKit to mount the drive
with your credentials.


Future goals
============

Our main goal is to expand the current functionality in order to provide a
decent replacement for disk-related use of halevt. Eventually, if it turns out
to be easy enough, we might support more events related to DeviceKit too.
