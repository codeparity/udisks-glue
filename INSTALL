Dependencies
============

Those are the dependencies needed to compile udisks-glue:

* DBus Glib bindings (libdbus-glib-1-dev in Debian)
* GLib (libglib2.0-dev in Debian)
* libConfuse (libconfuse-dev in Debian)
* pkg-config

If you want to compile the manual pages, you'll need something compatible with
nroff (groff-base in Debian works great).


Installation instructions
=========================

udisks-glue doesn't use autotools:

$ make PREFIX=/foo/bar
$ make PREFIX=/foo/bar install
